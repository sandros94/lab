A personal collection of Nuxt and Nitro tools.
The goal of this project is mainly to simplify my prototyping process and learn a few things about data manipulation, Vitest, CI and others in a _laboratory-like_ environment.

## Features

- `useMem`: integrates an in-memory kv store, build on-top of [`unstorage`](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage) and editable via `runtimeConfig` (server-only).
- `useFS`: integrates a filesystem storage, build on-top of [`unstorage`](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage) and editable via `runtimeConfig` (server-only).
- `useS3` (optional): integrates any S3 compatible storage, build on-top of [`unstorage`](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage) and editable via `runtimeConfig` (server-only).
- `useKV` (optional): integrates any Redis compatible KV stores, build on-top of [`unstorage`](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage) and editable via `runtimeConfig` (server-only).
- `useZlib` (optional): when enabled, it automatically provides gzip compression and decompression functions to `useMem`, `useFS` and `useKV` (server-only).
- `useWS`+`useWebSocketHandler` ([demo](https://reactive-ws.s94.dev/), optional): A WebSocket implementation with built-in shared state management, channel subscriptions, and type safety.
- **Built-in validation** (optional): using [`valibot`](https://valibot.dev) and [`h3-valibot`](https://github.com/intevel/h3-valibot) under the hood (client and server).

## Quick Setup

Install the module to your Nuxt application with one command:

```bash
npx nuxi module add @sandros94/lab
```

To enable or disable various features you can simply edit your `nuxt.config.ts` like so:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sandros94/lab'],

  lab: {
    cache: 'kv',  // 'mem', 'fs', 'kv' or null (default)
    s3: true,     // default false
    kv: true,     // default false
    zlib: true,   // default false
    valibot: true // default false
    cms: true     // default false
  }
})
```

`lab.mem`, `lab.kv` and `lab.zlib` also accept an object to edit their defaults options.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sandros94/lab'],

  lab: {
    mem: {
      ttl: 10 * 60,
    },
    fs: {
      base: '.data/myStore', // Default '.data/lab'
    },
    s3: {
      endpoint: 'https://example.com',
      region: 'us-east-1',
      bucket: 'myBucket',
      accessKeyId: '<your-access-key>',      // Best to use env vars
      secretAccessKey: '<your-secret-key>',  // Best to use env vars
    },
    kv: {
      ttl: 10 * 60,
    },
    cms: {
      addRoutes: true, // default true
    }
  }
})
```

You can also edit them via env vars: `NUXT_LAB_{MEM|FS|S3|KV|ZLIB}_*`. Useful in situations like editing `NUXT_LAB_KV_URL` at runtime without rebuilding the application.

## Utils

The `@sandros94/lab` module includes some utility functions:

### `useMem`

Based on [`unstorage`](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage) is a custom in-memory driver. It provides added functionality like time-based metadata, optional size calculation and TTL support with auto-purge.

```ts
const mem = useMem()

mem.setItem('key', 'value', { ttl: 60 }) // Expires in 60 seconds

const meta = mem.getMeta('key') // { ttl, atime, mtime, ctime, birthtime, size, timeoutId }
```

When combined with `zlib` it also receives the following functions:

- `setGzip`: Compresses data using gzip and stores it in the KV store.
- `getGzip`: Retrieves compressed data from the KV store without decompressing it.
- `getGunzip`: Retrieves compressed data from the KV store, decompresses it, and returns the original data.

### `useFS`

Based on `useStorage` and `usestorage`'s `fs` driver, to provide runtime-editable support for storing data on the filesystem.
It can also be combiled with `zlib` to provide gzip support as described above (by default a `.gz` suffix is added to the key).

>[NOTE]
>By default data is stored under `.data/lab` in the project root. You can change this by setting `lab.fs.base` in your `nuxt.config.ts`.

### `useS3` (optional)

Based on `useStorage` and `usestorage`'s `s3` driver, to provide runtime-editable support with any S3 compatible storages.
It can also be combiled with `zlib` to provide gzip support as described above (by default a `.gz` suffix is added to the key).

### `useKV` (optional)

Based on `useStorage` and `usestorage`'s `redis` driver, to provide runtime-editable support with any Redis compatible KV stores.
It can also be combiled with `zlib` to provide gzip support as described above.

### `useZlib` (optional)

Mainly used internally for `useKV`, it currently only provides the following functions:

- `gzip`: Compresses data using gzip.
- `gunzip`: Decompresses gzip-compressed data.

## `cache` (optional)

There is built-in support to use `useMem` or `useKV` as a cache provider. You can switch between them by setting `lab.cache` to either `'mem'` or `'kv'` or disable it via `null` (default). This automatically configures Nuxt and Nitro for caching server-side requests and functions.

## Real-time Remote State Management (optional)

A WebSocket implementation with built-in shared state management, channel subscriptions, and type safety.

- üîÑ Automatic reconnection
- üì¶ Built-in shared state management per channel
- üîê Type-safe messages and channels
- üì¢ Hooking system to trigger global or per-channel messages
- üíæ Easily add persistent storage with `useMem` or `useKV`

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sandros94/lab'],
  lab: {
    ws: {
      route: '/_ws',             // WebSocket endpoint
      channels: {
        internal: ['_internal'], // Protected system channels
        defaults: ['session'],   // Auto-subscribed channels
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Client-Side:
```ts
// Request additional channels during connection
const channels = ref(['chat', 'notifications'])

const { states, status, send } = useWS<{
  chat: {
    [userId: string]: string
  }
  notifications: {
    message: string
  }
}>(channels)

// Send message to chat channel
send('chat', { 
  [userId]: 'Hello world!'
})

// Access state
const chatMessages = toRef(states, 'chat')
```

Server-Side:
```ts
// server/routes/_ws.ts
export default useWebSocketHandler({
  async open(peer, { channels }) {
    // Subscribe to requested channels
    channels.forEach(channel => peer.subscribe(channel))
  },

  async message(peer, message, { channels }) {
    const { channel, data } = message.json()
    // Broadcast to channel subscribers
    peer.publish(channel, JSON.stringify({ channel, data }))
  }
})
```

#### Reactivity notes

The `state` object returned by `useWS` (and `useWSStates`) is not reactive, while its properties are indeed refs. This means that as long as you are accessing static channels you can safely destructure them, but not if they are based on dynamic ones.

```ts
// The following works
const { states } = useWS<{
  chat: {    // Defined here
    [userId: string]: string
  }
  session: { // Defined in nuxt.config.ts via `lab.ws.channels.defaults`
    user: number
  }
}>(['chat'])
const { chat, session } = states

// The following does not work
const selectedChannels = ref([])
const { states } = useWS<{
  [channel: string]: {
    [key: string]: string
  }
}>(selectedChannels)
const { myDynamicChannel } = states

// Instead you should access it directly as
states['myDynamicChannel']
```

## CMS (optional)

This is a highly experimental feature.
Much like [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com) it allows to load static content from a directory in your project (`cms` by default) and serve it via server util and api routes. The content will be bundled at build time and served both as JSON object (if the format is supported for conversion) and served as is, if the file extension is added in the request.

Supported formats:
- `.json`
- `.yaml` (`.yml`)
- `.toml` (`.tml`)
- `.md` (`.mdc`)

> [!NOTE]
> While markdown is supported and parsed via `@nuxtjs/mdc` under the hood, if you are looking for a proper markdown-based CMS, you should use [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com) instead.

Start by creating a `cms` directory in your project root and adding some content files.

```yaml
# cms/hello.yaml
title: Hello World
content: |
  This is a test content.
```

By default it will be served at `/_cms/hello` as JSON, but you can also access it as `/_cms/hello.yaml` to get the raw content.


If you want more control, you can disable the built-in routes via `lab.cms.addRoutes: false` (in your `nuxt.config.ts`) and create your own routes:

```ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const slug = getRouterParam(event, 'slug') || 'index'
  const data = await queryStaticContent(slug)

  if (!data) {
    throw createError({
      status: 404,
      message: 'Not found',
    })
  }

  return data
})
```
